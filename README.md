# 🧠 Reflection Agent Tweet Generator with LangGraph

This project implements a **Reflection Agent** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), designed to generate high-quality and context-aware tweets. The agent is capable of iteratively refining its outputs using structured reflection loops to improve clarity, engagement, and originality.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Generates concise, engaging tweets on various topics
- 🔁 Uses a reflection loop to improve tweet quality
- 🧩 Modular design with LangGraph for flexibility and extensibility
- 🔌 Easy to plug in your own prompt templates, models, or evaluators

## 📌 Use Cases

- Personal branding / thought leadership automation  
- Content creation for X (formerly Twitter)  
- Experimentation with reflection-style agents  
- NLP education and LangGraph demos  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)  
- OpenAI API / LLM of your choice  
- Python 3.11+  
- LangChain 

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

The agent follows a **reflect-think-write** loop:
1. **Generator Node**: creates an initial draft of a tweet.
2. **Critic Node**: critiques the draft based on style, clarity, or engagement.
3. **Router**: decides when to regenerate the tweet or finish.
3. **Final Output Node**: outputs the polished tweet.
